# Company Analysis

## Overview 

In this project, I examine company insights using an imaginary dataset. The dataset includes employee information such as department, salary contracts, and gender. With this information, we can gain valuable insights into the company.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Udemy course: [The Business Intelligence Analyst Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-business-intelligence-analyst-course-2018/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). It consists of five tables:
1. **Departments**: `dept_no`, `dept_name`
2. **dept_emp**: `emp_no`, `dept_no`, `from_date`, `to_date`
3. **dept_manager**: `emp_no`, `dept_no`, `from_date`, `to_date`
4. **Employees**: `emp_no`, `birth_date`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, `hire_date`
5. **Salaries**: `emp_no`, `salary`, `from_date`, `to_date`"

## Project Goals

In this project, I examine the gender analysis of employees. First, I compare the number of female versus male employees over the years. Then, I analyze salary data, comparing salaries by year and gender. Additionally, I conduct a salary analysis across different departments and evaluate the percentage of male and female employees whose salaries are above the average salary. I also analyze employees who have changed departments and identify the departments with the highest turnover.

## Process

SQL was the cornerstone of my analysis, enabling me to thoroughly examine the data and uncover crucial insights. I used Power BI for visualizing the data.

## Outcomes

Firstly, I examine the number of employees by year to compare genders. Despite the total number of employees over the years, female employees consistently make up 40% of the employees.
